- **Mind Games**: Includes "Untangle Your Mind," a relaxing puzzle game designed to help users focus and unwind without pressure or timers.
- **Self-Support Tools**: Resources for grounding, micro-steps, and daily stabilizers.
- **Safe Design**:
  - **Low-Stim Visuals**: Muted, warm color palette to reduce sensory overload.
  - **Quick Exit**: A prominent button allows users to leave the site instantly for safety.
  - **Privacy Focused**: No tracking or data collection described in the current scope.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
